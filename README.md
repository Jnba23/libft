# 📚 libft — Custom C Standard Library

A custom implementation of essential C standard library functions, built from scratch as the first foundational project at 42. The goal is to understand low-level memory operations, string manipulation, and function design.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Re-implemented standard C functions (string, memory, char checks, conversions)
- Linked list utilities
- Consistent API and header (`libft.h`)

---

## 🧠 Skills Learned
- Pointers & memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Static libraries & `ar` archiving
- Defensive programming
- Understanding C string and memory models
